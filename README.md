## About

This projects aims to enhance the efficiency of grocery retail outlets with our AI-driven self-checkout system, leveraging computer vision technology to enable quick and seamless transactions, ensuring a streamlined shopping experience for customers. Our solution aims to replace traditional cashiers, thereby improving profit margins and enabling automated AI-driven sales tracking and inventory replenishment.

## Data

The datataset used in this project is created by our team and is available in the `data` folder which includes images for 7 Indian daily used grocery items. 

This is a sample dataset, our future goal is to create a large dataset for various items to increase the efficiency as well coverage of our model.

## Usage

### Option 1: Streamlit Web Application (Recommended)

1. After downloading the dataset, unzip it and place in the root directory.
   
2. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/priyanshudutta04/AI-Self-Checkout.git
```

3. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the Streamlit Web Application
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Or use the helper script:
```
python run_app.py
```

The application will open in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Option 2: Original OpenCV Application

Run the original camera-based application:
```
python yolo_products.py
```

### Features
